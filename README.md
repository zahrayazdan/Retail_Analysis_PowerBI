# Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail sales dataset using Python and visualizes key metrics based on insights from Power BI. The analysis provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, profitability, shipping costs, and trends over time.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the 'SuperStoreUS_2015.xlsx' file and includes:
- Sales, Profit, Quantity, and Shipping Cost metrics.
- Product details (Category, Sub-Category).
- Customer Segment and Regional data.
- Order and Ship Dates for time-based analysis.

## Python Analysis

The Python script performs the following analyses:
1. **Total Sales and Profit Summary**: Calculates and displays the total sales and profit.
2. **Sales by Category**: Visualizes the distribution of total sales across product categories.
3. **Profit by Category and Customer Segment**: Analyzes total profit segmented by product category and customer type.
4. **Monthly Sales Trends**: Shows sales trends by month and year.
5. **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Visualizes shipping costs based on different shipping modes.
6. **Sales by Region and Ship Mode**: Compares total sales across different regions and shipping modes.
7. **Quantity Analysis by Month and Category**: Examines the quantity of products sold over time, segmented by product category.
8. **Profit Analysis by Year**: Analyzes annual profit trends.

The Power BI dashboard visualizes similar metrics with the following key components:
1. **Total Sales and Profit Summary**: Displays overall sales and profit figures.
2. **Sales by Category and Segment**: Highlights sales and profit distribution by product category and customer segment.
3. **Monthly and Yearly Trends**: Line charts showing sales and quantity trends over time.
4. **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Pie charts illustrating the distribution of shipping costs by mode.
5. **Regional Sales Analysis**: Bar charts comparing sales across different regions and ship modes.

## How to Run the Python Script

1. Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
   ```
2. Place the 'SuperStoreUS_2015.xlsx' file in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python retail_sales_analysis.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates comprehensive retail sales analysis using Python and Power BI. It highlights trends, profitability, and key performance metrics to aid in strategic business decisions.
